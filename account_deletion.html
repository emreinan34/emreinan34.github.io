    <h1>Account and Data Deletion</h1>
    
    <p>You have the right to request the permanent deletion of your LinguaLeap account. This action is irreversible. Please choose one of the two methods below to proceed.</p>
    
    <h2>Option 1: Delete From Inside the App</h2>
    <p>This is the fastest and recommended method if you have access to the application.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Open the LinguaLeap app on your device and log in.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab using the bottom navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Scroll to the bottom and tap the <strong>"Delete Account"</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Follow the on-screen prompts to confirm the permanent deletion of your account.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Option 2: Submit a Web Request</h2>
    <p>If you no longer have access to the app, you can submit a deletion request using our web form. Please ensure you provide the email address associated with your LinguaLeap account. Requests are processed manually and may take a few business days to complete.</p>
