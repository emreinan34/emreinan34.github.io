    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data That Is Retained</h2>
    <p>To maintain and improve our services, some data is retained in an aggregated and fully anonymized form. This data cannot be linked back to you personally after your account has been deleted. This includes:</p>

        <li><strong>Anonymized Performance Data:</strong> Anonymized crash logs and performance metrics from Firebase Crashlytics used for stability monitoring.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Retention Period in Backups</h2>
    <p>While your data is deleted from our live databases immediately upon request, it may persist in secure, encrypted backup archives for up to 90 days. After this period, the data is permanently erased from all backup systems.</p>
