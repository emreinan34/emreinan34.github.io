      Effective Date: July 6, 2025
      
      This Privacy Policy describes how Emre Ä°nan ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our mobile application, LinguaLeap (the "App").
      
      1. Information We Collect
      We collect information to provide and improve our services, including:
      
      Information You Provide Directly:
      Email Address & Authentication Information: When you create an account, we collect your email address and authentication details (such as a hashed password or authentication tokens from Google Sign-In) to create and secure your account.
      Display Name / Username: We collect the username you choose, which is used to identify you on public leaderboards within the App.
      
      Information Collected Automatically:
      Quiz Performance Data: We store your quiz scores and progress for different language pairs and durations to provide you with your high score reports and to rank you on leaderboards.
      Usage and Analytics Data: We use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect data about how you interact with the App. This includes information like which screens you visit, which buttons you tap, session duration, and general device information (e.g., device model, OS version). This helps us understand what features are popular and how to improve the user experience.
      Crash and Performance Data: We use Firebase Crashlytics to automatically collect crash reports and performance data. This helps us identify and fix bugs, and to monitor the stability of the App.
      
      2. How We Use Your Information
      We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
      
      To provide, operate, and maintain the App's core functionality (quizzes, scoring, etc.).
      To create and manage your user account.
      To display your username and score on public leaderboards.
      To personalize your experience.
      To analyze usage and trends to improve the App.
      To diagnose and fix technical issues and crashes.
      
      3. Third-Party Services
      We use the following third-party services which may collect information as described in their own privacy policies:
      
      Google Play Services: Used for core application services on Android.
      Firebase (a Google service): We use multiple Firebase services including Authentication, Firestore (database), Cloud Functions, Crashlytics, and Analytics. [Link to Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
      Google AdMob: We use AdMob to display advertisements within the App. AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized ads. You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use their services here: [How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).
